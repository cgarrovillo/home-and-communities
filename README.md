# Home and Communities
This is the repository for my solution to the Frontend Coding Exercise for OpenHouse.AI

Given the project's requirement for the use of a web framework in TypeScript, this implementation took me longer than I initially thought as I had to work-around some challenges and conflicts.

This marks my first-time using TypeScript, and have been enjoying it. The learning curve to me is steady as I already have experience with React using JavaScript. 
The concepts I struggled in the most was the types/interfaces + the use of services.

This was the initial plan I had sketched out. I had also planned to integrate with GoogleMaps, and possibly a "favourites" list keeping track of communities saved for later in a cookie. 
Like any other project, I underestimated the implementation time and did not have a chance to do these.

The time constraint was definitely a huge factor, which is pretty similar to my schoolwork given the scale. If I was given more time, I'd definitely approach this project differently:
- Project Requirements
  - I'd like to gather the tone I want to convey to the public. Is this to appeal to customers or to be used as a dashboard by a broker? Customer sided gives me more creative freedom & a dashboard type would mean more functionality & faster fetching.
- Dataset information
  - How many communities & homes are there?
- Implementation
  - I would implement the data validation fully (across all properties)
  - Faster algorithms for the iterations & sorting; again depending on the dataset
  - Finish mobile-friendly implementation
- Third party feedback
